# Verification Loops

> "Probably the most important thing to get great results - give AI a way to verify its work. If AI has that feedback loop, it will 2-3x the quality of the final result." - Boris Cherny

## Principle

Always verify changes after making them. This includes:
- Running tests
- Checking linting/formatting
- Type checking
- Manual verification when appropriate

## Stack-Specific Verification



## Browser Testing

Browser testing is disabled. Enable in precursor.json to use browser-based verification.

## Best Practices

1. **Always verify after changes**: Run relevant tests and checks
2. **Fix issues immediately**: Don't leave broken code
3. **Use verification loops**: Iterate until verification passes
4. **Document failures**: Add to PRECURSOR.md if verification reveals patterns

## Integration

Precursor automatically runs verification after scaffolding. Results are included in the setup output.

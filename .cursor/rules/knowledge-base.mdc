# Knowledge Base

## Principle

Before making changes, check `.cursor/PRECURSOR.md` (or the configured knowledge base file) for:
- Common mistakes and their fixes
- Project-specific patterns
- Tool configuration quirks
- Best practices

## Usage

1. **Before changes**: Read relevant sections of PRECURSOR.md
2. **After mistakes**: Document the issue and fix in PRECURSOR.md
3. **After learning**: Add new patterns and practices to PRECURSOR.md

## Integration

Precursor automatically initializes PRECURSOR.md during setup. Use the `add_knowledge_entry` MCP tool to add entries programmatically.

## Philosophy

This implements "Compounding Engineering" - the AI gets smarter about your codebase over time through accumulated team knowledge, similar to Boris Cherny's CLAUDE.md pattern.
